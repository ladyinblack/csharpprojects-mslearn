## GUIDED PROJECT: Calculate Final GPA

You're developing a Student GPA Calculator that will help calculate students' overall Grade Point Average.  The parameters for your application are: 
- You're given the student's name and class information.
- Each class has a name, the student's grade, and the number of credit hours for that class.
- Your application needs to perform basic math operations to calculate the GPA for the given student.
- Your application needs to output/display the student's name, class information, and GPA.

To calculate the GPA:
- Multiply the grade value for a course by the number of credit hours for that course.
- Do this for each course, then add these results together.
- Divide the resulting sum by the total number of credit hours.

You're provided with the following sample of a student's course information and GPA: 
``` 
Student: Sophia Johnson 

Course          Grade    Credit Hours
English 101         4        3
Algebra 101         3        3
Biology 101         3        4
Computer Science I  3        4
Psychology 101      4        3
``` 

## EXERCISE 1: Store the numeric grade values for each course
In this exercise, you'll begin setting up variables needed to calculate a student's GPA.
