## GUIDED PROJECT: Calculate Final GPA

You're developing a Student GPA Calculator that will help calculate students' overall Grade Point Average.  The parameters for your application are: 
- You're given the student's name and class information.
- Each class has a name, the student's grade, and the number of credit hours for that class.
- Your application needs to perform basic math operations to calculate the GPA for the given student.
- Your application needs to output/display the student's name, class information, and GPA.

To calculate the GPA:
- Multiply the grade value for a course by the number of credit hours for that course.
- Do this for each course, then add these results together.
- Divide the resulting sum by the total number of credit hours.

You're provided with the following sample of a student's course information and GPA: 
``` 
Student: Sophia Johnson 

Course          Grade    Credit Hours
English 101         4        3
Algebra 101         3        3
Biology 101         3        4
Computer Science I  3        4
Psychology 101      4        3
``` 

## EXERCISE 1: Store the numeric grade values for each course
In this exercise, you'll begin setting up variables needed to calculate a student's GPA.

## EXERCISE 2: Calculate the sums of credit hours and grade points
In this exercise, you'll calculate and store the total number of credit hours and the total grade points earned for each course.  These values will later be used to calculate the GPA.  Since both the credit hours and grade values are represented as whole numbers, you'll store the sums using the Integer data type.

## EXERCISE 3: Format the decimal output
In this exercise, you'll calculate the final GPA and modify the console output to achieve the desired reporting format.  The GPA is equal to the sum of the total grade points divided by the sum of the total credit hours.
