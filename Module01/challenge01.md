## CHALLENGE: Write code in the C# Code Editor to display two messages

Write code that produces the following output: 
```
This is the first line
This is the second line
```

In the previous unit, you learned how to display message in just one line of code, and you learned how to display a message using multiple lines of code. Use both techniques for this challenge.  It doesn't matter which technique you apply to which line, and it doesn't matter how many ways you split one of the messages into multiple lines of code. That's your choice.
